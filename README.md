> Unofficial Autodesk License Manager FLEXlmÂ® Network Server container.

## Usage

> To use this container, simply treat it as if you were calling _lmgrd_ directly. The only caveat is that the container **ALWAYS** appends the `-z` flag when executing _lmgrd_ internally so to ensure it runs in the Foreground; otherwise, Docker believes the command has finished executing, and the container is immediately stopped.

A typical usage example, where a single license file, `adsk_server.lic`, is saved to a local directory. This directory's path, `<local-license-path>`, is them mapped to the containers **/var/flexlm** directory, and is finally referenced as if calling as _lmgrd_ directly: `-c /var/flexlm/adsk_server.lic`.

```bash
docker run -d --mac-address=<license-mac-address> \
-h <license-hostname> \
-v <local-license-path>:/var/flexlm/adsk_server.lic:ro \
-p 2080:2080 -p 27000-27009:27000-27009 \
haysclark/adlmflexnetserver \
-c /var/flexlm/adsk_server.lic
```

Alternatively, you can map a local folder containing multiple keys to the **/var/flexlm** directory as well.

```bash
docker run -d --mac-address=<license-mac-address> \
-h <license-hostname> \
-v <local-license-folder-path>:/var/flexlm \
-p 2080:2080 -p 27000-27009:27000-27009 \
haysclark/adlmflexnetserver \
-c /var/flexlm/license_file_1:/var/flexlm/license_file_2
```

### Logging

Docker's built-in logging functionality will collect the stdout/stderr generated by _lmgrd_.

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

Thus it's recommended you do **NOT** use the `-l` flag to log to a file, doing so will cause your Docker logs to be empty. Additionally, avoid using the `-t` flag when using Docker's `run` command, enabling TTL support will cause extra line breaks in your Docker logs.

## Troubleshooting

If you are unsure if the server is running correctly, you can log into the container.

```bash
docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
```

Once in bash run:

```bash
lmutil lmstat -a -c <license-path>
```

## Building a custom Docker image

The base container is intended to support a wide range of cases; however, some _build arguments_ have been included to allow easy access to aspects of the build process.

### Build Arguments

The following build arguments have been exposed.

| Name      | Required | Description                                       |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| NLM_URL   | no       | URL to the NLM (Network License Manager) .gz file |
| TEMP_PATH | no       | temporary file path for installation              |

Usage example:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NLM_URL=<nlm-url> .
```
